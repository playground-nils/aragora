Golden Path 5: Knowledge-Enriched Debate
=========================================

Demonstrates how to query the Knowledge Mound for prior knowledge, then
inject that context into a debate so agents can reference organizational
data when making decisions.

The flow:
  1. Create a mock knowledge store with sample items
  2. Query the store with semantic search
  3. Inject retrieved knowledge as debate context
  4. Run a debate where agents reference the context
  5. Show how knowledge improves decision quality

No API keys or database required -- uses in-memory mock store.

Usage:
    python examples/golden_paths/knowledge_query/main.py

Expected runtime: <5 seconds
