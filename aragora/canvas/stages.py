"""
Idea-to-Execution Pipeline Stage Types.

Extends the canvas data model with stage-aware node types for the
four-stage pipeline: Ideas → Goals → Actions → Orchestration.

Each stage is a DAG view with a consistent visual language.
Nodes carry provenance linking every output back to originating ideas.
