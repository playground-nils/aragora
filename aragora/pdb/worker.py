"""Back-compat shim for :mod:`aragora.brief_engine.worker`.

The in-process brief-generation worker moved to
:mod:`aragora.brief_engine.worker` in the Phase 1 brief-engine
extraction. This module re-exports the worker types so existing Mode 3
callers continue to work. The worker's default runner calls back into
:func:`aragora.pdb.protocol.run_protocol_b` so Mode 3 submissions that
don't supply a custom ``runner`` behave exactly as before.

Do not add new worker logic here — put it in
:mod:`aragora.brief_engine.worker` instead.
