"""
Centralized defaults for the debate module.

This module extracts magic numbers and hardcoded values from across the debate
package into a single, documented, frozen dataclass. All values can be overridden
via environment variables where appropriate.

Usage:
    from aragora.debate.config.defaults import DEBATE_DEFAULTS

    # Access defaults
    threshold = DEBATE_DEFAULTS.convergence_threshold

    # Or get a fresh instance (useful for testing)
    from aragora.debate.config.defaults import get_debate_defaults
    defaults = get_debate_defaults()

Environment Variable Overrides:
    Many values can be overridden via environment variables with the
    ARAGORA_DEBATE_ prefix. For example:
    - ARAGORA_DEBATE_CONVERGENCE_THRESHOLD=0.90
    - ARAGORA_DEBATE_DIVERGENCE_THRESHOLD=0.35
    - ARAGORA_DEBATE_AGENT_TIMEOUT=45.0
