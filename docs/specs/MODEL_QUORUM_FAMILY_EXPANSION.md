# Model Quorum Family Expansion (Pre-Approval Design, Tier 4 implementation)

**Status:** draft, pending operator preapproval
**Owner:** Armand
**Date:** 2026-05-24
**Related:** `docs/REVIEW_AUTHORITY_PRINCIPLES.md`,
`docs/briefs/automation-merge-contract.md`,
`aragora/cli/commands/review_queue.py` (Tier 4 surface),
`aragora/swarm/pr_review_protocol.py`,
PR #7438 (the gap that motivated this)

## Why this exists

When PR #7438 attempted to clear its model-quorum gate, the reviewer
executor produced one partial signal (Claude logic reviewer, returned
`defer`) and zero countable signals from the other configured slots
(codex CLI stdin EAGAIN, gemini-cli auth missing, grok-cli API key
missing, mistral provider absent). Even with all four CLIs technically
"available on PATH", the quorum count was 0/2.

A separate but adjacent gap surfaced during that attempt: even when
heterogeneous Chinese open-weight families like DeepSeek, Qwen, and Kimi
*are* available via OpenRouter (and aragora's `api_agents/openrouter.py`
already wires them), they cannot be *counted* as reviewer signals because
`aragora/cli/commands/review_queue.py::_infer_model_reviewer_from_text`
only recognizes the marker substrings `claude / codex / openai / grok /
gemini / mistral / deepseek / qwen / kimi / tesla / harvey / factory`.
The recognizer was last grown in 2026-Q1; several Chinese-family models
that aragora now routes to are unrecognized, and the new May-2026
Western variants (Gemini 3.5 Flash, Grok 4.3) need explicit family
mapping.

This document proposes the narrowest viable expansion of the reviewer
pool and the governance contract it must satisfy. **It is the pre-
approval artifact, not the implementation.** The actual code change to
`review_queue.py` is Tier 4 per `docs/REVIEW_AUTHORITY_PRINCIPLES.md`
("merge-authority self-modifications") and requires human preapproval
before implementation AND before merge.

## Scope

### In scope (Tier 1, no operator preapproval needed)
1. This spec doc
2. A new privacy-tier-by-jurisdiction subsection in
   `docs/REVIEW_AUTHORITY_PRINCIPLES.md` codifying which model families
   are eligible for which Tier
3. Failing tests in `tests/governance/` demonstrating the current
   recognizer gap on the families enumerated below

### Out of scope for this PR (Tier 4, requires operator nod)
1. The actual `_infer_model_reviewer_from_text` patch
2. The new "open-weight skeptic" slot in `default_pr_review_protocol`
3. Any change to `aragora/swarm/pr_review_protocol.py` slot definitions

### Explicitly out of scope (separate PRs)
- Provider bootstrap fixes (gemini-cli auth, codex CLI stdin EAGAIN) —
  environmental, not gate-modification
- Bench harness for cost/quality comparison (PR-B, follow-on)
- Any wiring of these reviewers into operator-facing surfaces

## Current state inventory

### The recognizer gap is *bigger* than initially documented

While drafting this spec the governance tests in
`tests/governance/test_model_quorum_recognizer_gaps.py` surfaced an
inconvenient truth: `_infer_model_reviewer_from_text` in
`aragora/cli/commands/review_queue.py` only matches **seven** markers
today:

```python
for name in ("claude", "codex", "tesla", "harvey", "factory", "grok", "gemini"):
    if name in lower:
        return name
return "unknown_model_reviewer"
```

So even families that aragora *already pays for* (OpenAI, Mistral,
DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi via OpenRouter) cannot post a counted reviewer
signal today. A second downstream function
(`_normalize_model_reviewer_id` in the same file) has the broader list
with `anthropic / openai / gpt / deepseek / qwen / kimi / mistral`
markers, but it is only consulted *after* the recognizer already
returned `"unknown_model_reviewer"` — so it is dead code for those
families. This is the root of PR #7438's 0/2 model-quorum count even
when CLI providers were technically available.

### Family wiring + recognizer coverage table

| Family | Wired in `api_agents/` | Recognized today? | Proposed for quorum |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic / Claude | ✓ `anthropic/claude-opus-4.7` | ✓ `claude` | ✓ keep |
| OpenAI | ✓ `openai/gpt-5.5` | **✗ NOT recognized** | ✓ add |
| Google Gemini | ✓ `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | ✓ `gemini` | ✓ keep |
| Gemini 3.5 Flash | not yet pinned | ✓ via `gemini` | ✓ wire as routing alias |
| xAI Grok 4 | ✓ `x-ai/grok-4` | ✓ `grok` | ✓ keep |
| xAI Grok 4.3 | not yet pinned | ✓ via `grok` | ✓ wire as routing alias |
| Mistral | ✓ `mistralai/mistral-large-*` | **✗ NOT recognized** | ✓ add (EU-jurisdiction routing only) |
| DeepSeek | ✓ `deepseek/deepseek-v3.2 / r1 / v4-pro` | **✗ NOT recognized** | ✓ add |
| Qwen | ✓ `qwen/qwen3-max / 235b / 3.5-plus` | **✗ NOT recognized** | ✓ add |
| Kimi (Moonshot) | ✓ `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6 / k2.5 / thinking` | **✗ NOT recognized** | ✓ add |
| Yi (01.AI) | ✓ `01-ai/yi-large` | **✗ NOT recognized** | ✓ add |
| Codex (vendor name) | n/a (CLI) | ✓ `codex` | ✓ keep |
| Tesla / Harvey / Factory | n/a (vendor names) | ✓ pinned | ✓ keep |

### NOT YET wired anywhere in `aragora/agents/api_agents/` (new additions)

| Family | OpenRouter id | Why add |
|---|---|---|
| **GLM-4.6** (Zhipu) | `z-ai/glm-4.6` (or `zhipuai/glm-4.6`) | Strong reasoning + agentic; distinct family from DeepSeek; sane prices |
| **MiniMax M2** | `minimax/minimax-m2` | Distinct training lineage; multimodal capable |
| **Nous Hermes 4** (Western open-weight) | `nousresearch/hermes-4-405b` | Western-jurisdiction balance to the Chinese cluster |
| **Gemini 3.5 Flash** (Western, agentic-tier) | `google/gemini-3.5-flash` | 4× faster, $1.50/$9, wins on agentic/coding benchmarks (76% Terminal-Bench 2.1, 84% MCP Atlas), loses on pure reasoning vs 3.1 Pro — both have a place |
| **Grok 4.3** (Western, May 2026) | `x-ai/grok-4.3` | Released 2026-05-06; 20% cheaper than 4.20; strong on CaseLaw/CorpFin; **weak on coding/hard math** (13th place), so role-restricted to policy/governance lenses |

### NOT YET wired anywhere in `aragora/agents/api_agents/`

| Family | OpenRouter id | Reason to add |
|---|---|---|
| **GLM-4.6** (Zhipu) | `z-ai/glm-4.6` (or `zhipuai/glm-4.6`) | Strong reasoning + agentic; distinct family from DeepSeek; sane prices |
| **MiniMax M2** | `minimax/minimax-m2` | Distinct training lineage; multimodal capable |
| **Nous Hermes 4** (Western open-weight) | `nousresearch/hermes-4-405b` | Western-jurisdiction balance to the Chinese cluster |
| **Gemini 3.5 Flash** (Western, agentic-tier) | `google/gemini-3.5-flash` | 4× faster, $1.50/$9, wins on agentic/coding benchmarks (76% Terminal-Bench 2.1, 84% MCP Atlas), loses on pure reasoning vs 3.1 Pro — both have a place |
| **Grok 4.3** (Western, recent) | `x-ai/grok-4.3` | Released 2026-05-06; 20% cheaper than 4.20; strong on CaseLaw/CorpFin; **weak on coding/hard math**, so role-restricted to policy/governance lenses |

## Family-by-Tier-by-Jurisdiction privacy contract

This is the "be careful" codification. Adding more reviewer families
without an explicit tier/jurisdiction policy would silently weaken the
gate for high-Tier work.

### Tier-eligibility matrix

| Tier | Western families (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Mistral, Nous) | Chinese-routed families (DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, GLM, MiniMax, Yi) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 (docs, status) | ✓ counted | ✓ counted |
| 1 (additive internal, no live caller) | ✓ counted | ✓ counted |
| 2 (live automation, CLI, observability, retry, cache) | ✓ counted | ✓ counted; **at least 1 of the 2 required signals must be Western** |
| 3 (semantic correctness, persistence, security, public API, migrations) | ✓ counted | **Advisory-only — not counted toward quorum** |
| 4 (secrets, deployment, workflow policy, destructive ops, merge-authority self-mod) | ✓ counted | **Advisory-only — not counted; one signal must be Anthropic or OpenAI** |

### Privacy-jurisdiction-routing rule

Independent of Tier, the **payload sent to the reviewer** determines
jurisdiction eligibility:

| Payload type | Western families | Chinese-routed families |
|---|---|---|
| PR title + diff (public OSS repo) | ✓ | ✓ |
| PR title + diff (private repo, no PII) | ✓ | ✓ if repo policy permits |
| Inbox triage features (low-information, no body) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Inbox triage *raw email body* | ✓ if AWS Secrets Manager loaded | **✗ never** |
| Customer PII / financials / credentials | ✓ if data-residency policy permits | **✗ never** |
| Healthcare / regulated data | Vertical-specific allowlist only | **✗ never** |

### Rationale

- **Tier 2 mixed-Western-Chinese quorum:** lets us realize the cost
  advantage of DeepSeek/Qwen/Kimi/GLM on routine automation work while
  preserving one Western alignment-trained reviewer for behavioral
  sanity. Concretely: a 2/2 quorum of `claude` + `deepseek` counts;
  `deepseek` + `qwen` alone does not for Tier 2.
- **Tier 3+ Western-only:** the calibration concerns for high-stakes
  decisions outweigh the cost savings. Chinese models can still post
  advisory comments (and the executor can still query them), but they
  don't gate the merge.
- **PII never routed to Chinese providers:** treats jurisdiction as a
  hard boundary, not a soft preference. This is the same discipline the
  AFT extractor enforces (low-information features only; no diffs, no
  comment bodies, no PII).

## Recognizer changes (Tier 4 — needs preapproval before I implement)

Note: the patch needs to fix `_infer_model_reviewer_from_text` first
(the narrow 7-marker tuple is the actual gate-blocker), then ensure
`_normalize_model_reviewer_id` stays in sync with the recognizer's
output. The two functions diverged at some point and the recognizer is
the bottleneck.

### Patch sketch — `_infer_model_reviewer_from_text` (the gate-blocker)

Replace today's 7-marker tuple:

```python
# CURRENT (gate-blocker):
for name in ("claude", "codex", "tesla", "harvey", "factory", "grok", "gemini"):
    if name in lower:
        return name
return "unknown_model_reviewer"
```

with a table that mirrors `_normalize_model_reviewer_id`'s known-markers
list, so the two stay in sync by construction:

```python
# PROPOSED:
_REVIEWER_MARKERS = (
    ("claude",   ("claude", "anthropic")),
    ("openai",   ("openai", "gpt")),
    ("gemini",   ("gemini", "google")),
    ("grok",     ("grok", "xai", "x-ai")),
    ("mistral",  ("mistral", "codestral")),
    ("codex",    ("codex",)),
    ("deepseek", ("deepseek",)),
    ("qwen",     ("qwen",)),
    ("kimi",     ("kimi", "moonshot", "moonshotai")),
    ("yi",       ("yi-large", "01-ai")),
    ("glm",      ("glm", "zhipu", "z-ai", "zhipuai")),
    ("minimax",  ("minimax",)),
    ("hermes",   ("hermes", "nous", "nousresearch")),
    ("tesla",    ("tesla",)),
    ("harvey",   ("harvey",)),
    ("factory",  ("factory",)),
)
for family, aliases in _REVIEWER_MARKERS:
    if any(a in lower for a in aliases):
        return family
return "unknown_model_reviewer"
```

The same table feeds `_normalize_model_reviewer_id` (refactor: pull
`_REVIEWER_MARKERS` to module-scope, both functions iterate it).

### Patch sketch — `_normalize_model_reviewer_id` (kept in sync)

Same `known_markers` table — see below. Today's version omits
yi/glm/minimax/hermes; the proposed addition extends them:

```python
known_markers = (
    ("claude",   ("claude", "anthropic")),
    ("openai",   ("openai", "gpt")),
    ("gemini",   ("gemini", "google")),
    ("grok",     ("grok", "xai", "x-ai")),
    ("mistral",  ("mistral", "codestral")),
    ("codex",    ("codex",)),
    # --- already-wired Chinese families recognized in recognizer:
    ("deepseek", ("deepseek",)),
    ("qwen",     ("qwen",)),
    ("kimi",     ("kimi", "moonshot", "moonshotai")),
    # --- proposed additions:
    ("yi",       ("yi-large", "01-ai")),
    ("glm",      ("glm", "zhipu", "z-ai", "zhipuai")),
    ("minimax",  ("minimax",)),
    ("hermes",   ("hermes", "nous", "nousresearch")),
    # --- existing markers unrelated to this PR:
    ("tesla",    ("tesla",)),
    ("harvey",   ("harvey",)),
    ("factory",  ("factory",)),
)
```

Plus the family-jurisdiction mapping (new helper):

```python
_WESTERN_FAMILIES = frozenset({
    "claude", "openai", "gemini", "grok", "mistral", "codex", "hermes",
})
_CHINESE_FAMILIES = frozenset({
    "deepseek", "qwen", "kimi", "yi", "glm", "minimax",
})

def _is_western_family(family: str) -> bool:
    return family in _WESTERN_FAMILIES

def _quorum_counts_family(family: str, tier: int) -> bool:
    """Return whether `family` counts toward the quorum at `tier`."""
    if not family:
        return False
    if tier <= 2:
        return True  # all recognized families count
    return _is_western_family(family)  # Tier 3+ Western-only
```

Plus the Tier-2 "at least one Western" rule (one branch in
`_build_model_review_quorum` near the `signal_count >= required` check).

The diff is small (~40 lines including the helpers + one branch). The
Tier 4 escalation is about the *governance significance*, not the line
count.

## Failing tests landed in this PR (Tier 1)

`tests/governance/test_model_quorum_recognizer_gaps.py` — proves the
current state of the gate so the eventual Tier 4 patch has a regression
target:

1. `test_glm_marker_currently_unrecognized` — input mentions
   `"GLM independent semantic review on head abc1234"`, asserts the
   current recognizer returns `unknown_model_reviewer`. After the Tier 4
   patch lands this test will need to be inverted (or replaced).
2. `test_minimax_marker_currently_unrecognized` — same shape, MiniMax.
3. `test_yi_marker_currently_unrecognized` — same shape, Yi.
4. `test_hermes_marker_currently_unrecognized` — same shape, Nous Hermes.
5. `test_existing_recognizers_still_work` — sanity that the existing
   claude/openai/gemini/grok/mistral/deepseek/qwen/kimi markers still
   resolve correctly. This is the regression floor — the Tier 4 patch
   must keep these passing.
6. `test_unknown_garbage_stays_unknown` — input that mentions no model
   family at all returns `unknown_model_reviewer`. Guards against
   over-eager recognizers that match arbitrary substrings.

These tests are *governance tests* and live under `tests/governance/` so
they can be required CI for any future change to the recognizer.

## Open questions for operator preapproval

1. **Tier 4 nod:** do you accept the proposed recognizer expansion +
   helper additions in `aragora/cli/commands/review_queue.py` as
   appropriately scoped, with the family/tier rules above?
2. **Family additions:** should `yi`, `glm`, `minimax`, `hermes`,
   `gemini-3.5-flash`, `grok-4.3` all be wired? Or some subset?
3. **Tier 3 "advisory-only" framing:** is Chinese-family advisory
   posting OK at Tier 3 (just not counted toward quorum), or should
   Tier 3 paths suppress Chinese reviewers entirely?
4. **PR author posting recognized markers:** if `an0mium` (PR author)
   posts a comment that mentions a model family, should that count?
   Today's recognizer would catch it; the four-factor independence rule
   says no. Recommend adding an explicit author-exclusion rule in the
   same patch.

## Operator preapproval — answers received 2026-05-24

**Directionally approved. Tighten before marking ready.** Operator
answers (transcribed verbatim from the preapproval message):

1. **Yes**, preapprove a follow-on Tier 4 recognizer patch that
   **replaces the hard-coded reviewer-name loop with a table-driven
   `_REVIEWER_MARKERS`, kept in sync with `_normalize_model_reviewer_id`**.

2. **Include markers for** `anthropic/claude`, `openai/gpt`,
   `gemini/google`, `grok/xai`, `deepseek`, `qwen`, `kimi/moonshot`,
   `glm/z-ai`, `minimax`, `hermes/nous`, `yi`, and `mistral/codestral`.
   **Mistral is retained for EU/regulatory diversity and backward
   compatibility, not because it is a preferred capability reviewer.**

3. **Tier policy:** Tier 0-2 may count Chinese/open-weight families
   if the payload is non-sensitive and exact-head grounded. Tier 3+
   requires Western-family counted quorum; Chinese-routed families
   may post advisory comments but must not satisfy the gate. **Tier 4
   governance changes require Western-only counted quorum.** Raw PII,
   inbox bodies, financials, healthcare, secrets, customer data, and
   private legal material must not be routed to Chinese-routed /
   OpenRouter providers.

4. **Yes**, add explicit PR-author / comment-author exclusion in the
   same patch. A PR author must not be able to satisfy model quorum
   by posting `# Claude review` or equivalent.

These answers are the binding scope for the Tier 4 PR-A2 patch (to be
opened separately from a fresh worktree off origin/main). The
principles-doc tier matrix below has been tightened to reflect
answer #3's stricter Tier 4 wording ("Western-only counted quorum"
replaces my draft "at least one Anthropic-or-OpenAI signal").

## Model ID source-of-truth (verified against provider docs 2026-05-24)

Per the operator's correction "Do not hard-code 'latest' from memory.
Verify against provider docs/API listings and document any mismatch":

| Family | Repo pin (default) | Provider-official current | Status | Action for PR-A2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.7` (in `api_agents/anthropic.py`) | `claude-opus-4-7` (Opus 4.7 GA per Anthropic blog 2026-04-16) | ✓ **aligned** | none — repo pin matches provider |
| OpenAI | `openai/gpt-5.5` (alias destination in `api_agents/openrouter.py`) | `gpt-5.5` (flagship per OpenAI API docs) | ✓ **aligned** | none |
| Google Gemini | `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (default in `api_agents/gemini.py`) | `gemini-3-pro` (still GA) and `gemini-3.5-flash` (GA 2026-05-20, agentic-tier) | ⚠ **repo does not yet pin 3.5 Flash** | PR-A2 routing alias addition: wire `gemini-3.5-flash` as the agentic-task routing target; keep `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` for reasoning/long-context |
| xAI Grok | `x-ai/grok-4` (default in `api_agents/grok.py`; `grok-4.2` noted as "not yet on OpenRouter") | `grok-4.3` (launched 2026-04-30, ~40% cheaper than 4.20, on OpenRouter) | ⚠ **repo does not yet pin 4.3** | PR-A2 routing alias addition: wire `grok-4.3` for policy/governance reviewer slot; keep `grok-4` for back-compat alias |
| Mistral | `mistralai/mistral-large-*` | (operator's posture: retained for EU/regulatory diversity; not a preferred capability reviewer) | aligned | none on pin; tier-policy demotion captured in principles doc |
| Open-weight (DeepSeek/Qwen/Kimi/Yi) | various (`deepseek/v3.2`, `qwen/qwen3-max`, `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6`, `01-ai/yi-large`) | match provider model pages | aligned | recognizer additions only |
| GLM / MiniMax / Hermes | not yet wired | `z-ai/glm-4.6`, `minimax/minimax-m2`, `nousresearch/hermes-4-405b` | new wirings needed | wire in `api_agents/openrouter.py` alongside recognizer additions |

**Mismatch tally:** **0 hard mismatches** between repo pins and provider-
official IDs. **2 "lagging on newest variant" cases**: Gemini 3.5 Flash
and Grok 4.3 are real and current per provider docs but not yet pinned
in `api_agents/`. These are routing-alias additions, not pin corrections.

I am **not silently blessing the repo pins.** The above table records
my verification against provider docs as of 2026-05-24 and should be
re-verified before PR-A2 is implemented in case provider docs have
shifted (model IDs can change weekly in this space). The
verification command pattern is: `WebFetch` against each provider's
canonical models page, compare to repo `api_agents/<family>.py`
default model and alias map.

## Note on PR-B

The bench harness scaffold PR-B (PR **#7451** on branch
`codex/claude-20260524-042836-bb3096b9`) is already open as a draft
on a separate worktree off origin/main. It contains no gate-policy
changes and no live provider calls in this iteration — only the
stub-backed orchestrator, scoring helpers, synthetic corpus, and
34 unit tests. The operator's "Phase 3" directive ("Use the AFT
pattern: pre-registered hypotheses, fixed eval set, cost/latency
capture, head-grounded outputs") matches PR-B's design; no
additional work is needed to fulfill that directive beyond what is
already in #7451.

## Net assessment

The expansion is technically small (~40 lines + tests) and
substantively meaningful (it unblocks 5+ heterogeneous reviewer
families that aragora *already pays for* via OpenRouter but cannot
*count*). The governance discipline lives in the family/tier matrix:
mixed quorums for routine work, Western-only quorums for high-stakes
work, jurisdictional payload boundaries always.

This PR lands the spec, the contract, and the failing tests. The patch
itself waits for operator preapproval per the Tier 4 rule.
