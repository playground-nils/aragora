Aragora bots allow your team to:
- Start multi-agent debates from chat
- Run stress-test validations on decisions
- Check system status
- Vote on debate outcomes
- Receive debate results in threads

All platforms share a common command framework, so the experience is consistent across Discord, Teams, Zoom, and Slack.

  },
  "description": {
    "short": "Multi-agent debate and validation",
    "full": "Run multi-agent debates and stress-test validations directly in Teams"
  },
  "icons": {
    "color": "color.png",
    "outline": "outline.png"
  },
  "bots": [
    {
      "botId": "your-app-id",

  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

### Step 6: Configure Tenant ID (Required for Graph API)

TEAMS_APP_ID=your-app-id
TEAMS_APP_PASSWORD=your-client-secret
TEAMS_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id  # Required for Graph API features
```

**Feature Availability by Configuration:**

---

## Architecture

### Bot Framework

All bots share a common framework:

```
aragora/bots/
├── base.py         # Common classes (BotUser, CommandContext, etc.)
├── commands.py     # Command registry and built-in commands
├── discord_bot.py  # Discord-specific implementation
├── teams_bot.py    # Teams-specific implementation
└── zoom_bot.py     # Zoom-specific implementation
```

### Request Flow

```
Chat Platform → Webhook Handler → Command Registry → Execute → Response
```

1. **Webhook Handler**: Validates signatures, parses platform-specific payload
2. **Command Registry**: Routes to appropriate command handler
3. **Execute**: Runs the command (debate, gauntlet, etc.)
4. **Response**: Formats platform-specific response (embeds, cards, etc.)

### Extending Commands

To add a custom command:

```python
from aragora.bots.commands import get_default_registry, BotCommand
from aragora.bots.base import CommandContext, CommandResult

registry = get_default_registry()

@registry.command(
    name="custom",
    description="My custom command",
    usage="custom <args>",
)
async def handle_custom(ctx: CommandContext) -> CommandResult:
    return CommandResult(
        success=True,
        message=f"Custom response for {ctx.raw_args}",
    )
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Discord: "Invalid Interaction"

- Verify your Public Key is correct
- Ensure Interactions Endpoint URL is accessible
- Check server logs for signature verification errors

### Teams: Bot Not Responding

- Verify Messaging Endpoint is correct
- Check Azure Bot health in portal
- Ensure Teams channel is enabled

### Teams: Graph API Errors (File Operations, Channel History)

- **401 Unauthorized**: Verify `TEAMS_TENANT_ID` is set correctly
- **403 Forbidden**: Check that admin consent was granted for required permissions
- **404 Not Found**: Verify `team_id` is passed for channel-scoped operations
- **Rate Limit (429)**: Implement exponential backoff; Teams connector handles this automatically
- **File upload fails**: Ensure `Files.ReadWrite.All` permission is granted
- **Channel history empty**: Ensure `ChannelMessage.Read.All` permission is granted

**Debug Graph API token:**
```bash
# Decode your token to check permissions
echo $GRAPH_TOKEN | cut -d. -f2 | base64 -d 2>/dev/null | jq .roles
```

### Zoom: Webhook Verification Failed

- Verify Secret Token matches
- Check timestamp header is present
- Ensure webhook URL is HTTPS

### Slack: Command Timeout

- Slash commands must respond within 3 seconds
- For long operations, respond with acknowledgment then use `response_url`
- Check Slack app Event Subscriptions are enabled

### Telegram: Bot Not Responding

- Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct
- Check webhook is properly set via `getWebhookInfo` API
- Ensure `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches the `secret_token` used in setWebhook
- Check server logs for secret token verification errors

### WhatsApp: Webhook Verification Failed

- Verify `WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` matches the token in Meta webhook configuration
- For signature errors, check `WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` is correct
- Ensure webhook URL is HTTPS and publicly accessible
- Check Meta App Dashboard for webhook delivery status

### General: Rate Limiting

- Commands have built-in rate limiting (10/minute per user)
- Debates have additional rate limits based on organization tier
- Check `/api/bots/<platform>/status` for configuration status

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Never commit tokens**: Use environment variables
2. **Verify signatures**: All platforms provide signature verification
3. **Use HTTPS**: All webhook endpoints must be HTTPS in production
4. **Limit scopes**: Request only necessary permissions
5. **Audit logs**: All bot commands are logged for audit
