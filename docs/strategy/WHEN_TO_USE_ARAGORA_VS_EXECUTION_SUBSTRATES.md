# When To Use Aragora Vs Execution Substrates

This is the practical decision table for operating Aragora alongside tools like
Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, and Pi.

The explicit boundary is captured in the [Non-Goals Ledger](NON_GOALS_LEDGER.md):
Aragora is the control plane above execution substrates, not a generic
autonomous-agent platform that tries to replace them.

## Default Rule

Use the **simplest layer that preserves the needed truthfulness**.

If the task only needs raw execution, use a worker runtime.
If the task needs receipts, review, provenance, or truthful blocker handling,
use Aragora.

## Decision Table

| Situation | Best default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Small code edit with clear scope | Single strong coding agent | Lowest coordination overhead |
| One owner, 2-4 bounded parallel subtasks | Lead agent plus bounded subagents | Keeps ownership clear while getting real parallelism |
| Vague natural-language request | Lead agent first | Someone has to frame, slice, and own integration |
| High-stakes review or merge decision | Aragora | Receipts, dissent, gates, and blocker truth matter |
| Unattended multi-step execution | Aragora | Queue, watch, integrate, and truthful terminalization are the point |
| Pure terminal productivity for one developer | Codex / Claude Code / OpenCode / Pi | Fastest path, lowest ceremony |
| Model-routing experiments | OpenCode/Pi or direct worker harnesses | Good substrate for worker-level routing |
| Building Aragora itself | Lead agent plus bounded subagents, optionally under Aragora for proof runs | Orchestration overhead must stay bounded |

## Recommended Operating Modes

### 1. Single-agent mode

Use when:

- the task is small
- scope is obvious
- integration risk is low

Best tools:

- Codex
- Claude Code
- other direct coding agents

### 2. Lead agent plus bounded subagents

Use when:

- the prompt is vague
- you need a decomposition pass
- there are a few independent sidecar tasks

This is the default mode for building Aragora itself.

Why:

- one agent owns framing and integration
- a few workers handle isolated slices
- coordination stays legible

### 3. Aragora control-plane mode

Use when:

- the work is consequential
- a receipt is valuable
- review and publish behavior must be explicit
- unattended execution needs truthful stopping behavior

Why:

- Aragora's value starts where worker runtimes stop
- it owns governance, not just execution

### 4. Worker-runtime mode

Use OpenCode, Pi, Codex, Claude Code, or similar tools directly when:

- you mainly need execution speed
- auditability is not the main bottleneck
- the task does not need a control plane

These tools are better treated as substrates than as strategic enemies.

## A Note On "Whole Orchestras"

Large heterogeneous swarms sound appealing, but they fail quickly when:

- the prompt is vague
- scopes overlap
- state propagation lies
- verification evidence is weak
- no one clearly owns integration

So the default should not be "spawn a huge orchestra."

The better sequence is:

1. one lead agent frames the task
2. a few bounded workers handle independent slices
3. Aragora governs when the work becomes consequential enough to need receipts, gates, and truthfulness

## Strategic Implication

Aragora should not try to beat OpenCode or Pi at being execution substrates.

Aragora should sit above them:

- selecting when deeper governance is needed
- preserving receipts and provenance
- making disagreement useful
- turning "needs human" into a precise, low-cost next action
