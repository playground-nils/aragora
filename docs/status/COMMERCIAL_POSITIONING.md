# Aragora: Commercial Positioning & Value Proposition

**Control Plane for Multi-Agent Vetted Decisionmaking Across Org Knowledge and Channels**

*Version 2.8.0 | February 2026*
*Status: Internal positioning document; numbers verified against codebase.*

---

## Executive Summary

Aragora is the control plane for multi-agent vetted decisionmaking—orchestrating 43 agent types to debate your organization's knowledge (documents, databases, APIs) and deliver defensible decisions to any channel (Slack, Teams, Discord, voice). Unlike chatbots and single-model wrappers, Aragora builds institutional memory with full audit trails.

**Key Value:** Replace expensive human expert review ($15K-$100K per decision) with orchestrated multi-agent vetted decisionmaking that runs in 15-45 minutes, produces compliance-ready Decision Receipts, and builds organizational knowledge over time.

## Product Positioning

### What Aragora Is

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Primary** | Control Plane for Multi-Agent Vetted Decisionmaking |
| **Secondary** | Decision Assurance Platform for High-Stakes Teams |
| **Technical** | Enterprise AI Orchestration with Institutional Memory |

### What Aragora Is NOT

- **Not a chatbot** - Structured vetted decisionmaking protocol with phases, roles, and evidence chains
- **Not a copilot** - Institutional learning that ACCUMULATES organizational knowledge
- **Not single-model** - Heterogeneous 43 agent-type ensemble that argues toward truth
- **Not stateless** - Remembers outcomes, builds knowledge graphs, improves itself
- **Not text-only** - Multimodal ingestion (PDF, Office, HTML, JSON, CSV, audio, images) + multi-channel bidirectional output

## Target Customers

### Primary Segments

| Segment | Pain Point | Aragora Solution |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| **Platform Engineering** | Architecture decisions lack rigor | Gauntlet stress-testing with audit trail |
| **Security Teams** | Manual security review bottlenecks | Automated adversarial security analysis |
| **Compliance/GRC** | AI decisions lack documentation | DecisionReceipts for audit evidence |
| **AI/ML Teams** | Model outputs are untrusted | Multi-model consensus validation |

### Ideal Customer Profile

- **Size:** 50-5,000 employees (mid-market to enterprise)
- **Industry:** Financial services, healthcare, legal, enterprise SaaS
- **Maturity:** Already using AI/LLMs in production
- **Trigger:** Regulatory pressure, security incident, scaling review bottleneck

---

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. Cooperative Agent Frameworks (AutoGen, CrewAI)

| Dimension | Cooperative Frameworks | Aragora |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| Architecture | Agents collaborate on tasks | Agents debate and critique each other |
| Output | Task completion | Decision validation + dissent record |
| Use Case | Automation, workflows | Stress-testing, validation, governance |
| Blind Spots | Shared (single paradigm) | Diverse (heterogeneous models required) |

**Positioning:** "AutoGen helps agents work together. Aragora makes them argue. Use both."

### vs. Human Expert Review

| Dimension | Human Review | Aragora |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Cost | $15,000-$100,000 | $0.10-$2.00 per debate |
| Time | 2-6 weeks | 15-45 minutes |
| Consistency | Variable | Reproducible |
| Scalability | Limited | Unlimited |
| Audit Trail | Manual documentation | Automatic DecisionReceipts |

**Positioning:** "Expert review quality at API call prices."

### vs. Single AI Model

| Dimension | Single Model | Aragora |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Blind Spots | Correlated | Diverse (heterogeneous) |
| Self-Correction | Limited | Enforced through debate |
| Confidence | Uncertain | Consensus-based scoring |
| Dissent | Lost | Preserved and tracked |

**Positioning:** "One model can't catch its own mistakes. Three models can."

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Adversarial Debate Engine

**What:** Structured debate between heterogeneous AI models with role assignment (proposer, critic, synthesizer, judge).

**Why It Matters:** Different models have different blind spots. By requiring disagreement and synthesis, Aragora catches errors that single-model validation misses.

**Technical:** 9-round debate protocol, 8 consensus modes, convergence detection, early exit optimization.

### 2. Gauntlet Mode

**What:** Productized adversarial stress-testing with pre-configured attack personas.

| Persona | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| Security | Injection, auth, API vulnerabilities |
| Devil's Advocate | Logic flaws, hidden assumptions |
| Scaling Critic | Bottlenecks, SPOFs |
| Compliance | GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, AI Act |

**Why It Matters:** Go/no-go gate for CI/CD pipelines. Executive-ready output.

### 3. DecisionReceipts

**What:** Audit-ready decision records with risk heatmaps, dissent trails, and evidence chains.

**Why It Matters:** Compliance teams need documentation. DecisionReceipts provide the paper trail for SOC 2, AI Act, and internal governance.

**Format:** JSON (machine-readable) + Markdown (human-readable) + PDF (executive-ready).

### 4. Formal Verification

**What:** Z3 SMT solver integration for mathematical proof of claims.

**Why It Matters:** When models agree on a mathematical property, Z3 can prove it's correct. Moves from "likely true" to "provably true."

**Use Cases:** Invariant validation, boundary conditions, access control policies.

### 5. Multi-Provider Integration

**Supported Providers (6+, 43 agent types):**
- **Direct APIs:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Mistral, xAI Grok
- **OpenRouter:** DeepSeek, Qwen, Yi, Llama, Kimi (auto-fallback on 429)
- **Local:** Ollama, LM Studio

**Why It Matters:** Heterogeneous models catch more errors than homogeneous ones. Different training data = different blind spots.

## Pricing Model

*Illustrative tiering for planning. Validate pricing before external use.*
