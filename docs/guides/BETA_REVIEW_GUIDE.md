# Aragora Review -- Beta User Guide

Multi-agent AI code review that debates your diffs.

## Quick Start (2 minutes)

```bash
# Install
pip install aragora

# Set at least one API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Try the demo (no API key needed)
aragora review --demo

# Review your code
git diff main | aragora review
```

## What It Does

`aragora review` runs a **multi-round debate** between AI models (Claude, GPT, Gemini, etc.) on your code changes. Each model reviews independently, then they critique each other's findings, revise positions, and vote on final issues.

You get:
- **Unanimous findings** -- issues all models agree on (high confidence)
- **Split opinions** -- where models disagree (transparent uncertainty)
- **Severity levels** -- CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW
- **Agreement score** -- overall confidence metric

## Usage

### Review a diff from stdin
```bash
git diff main | aragora review
```

### Review a GitHub PR
```bash
aragora review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```
Requires `gh` CLI installed.

### Review a diff file
```bash
git diff main > changes.diff
aragora review --diff-file changes.diff
```

| `--focus` | `security,performance,quality` | Review focus areas |
| `--output-format` | `github` | `github`, `json`, or `html` |

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
name: Code Review
on: pull_request

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run Aragora Review
        uses: synaptent/aragora/.github/actions/aragora-review@main
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ARAGORA_API_KEY }}
          personas: security,performance
```

### Generic CI (exit code gating)
```bash
git diff $BASE_SHA | aragora review --ci --output-format json
# Exit 0 = clean, 1 = critical, 2 = high severity
```

## Cost Estimates

| Config | ~Cost |
|--------|-------|
| 2 agents, 2 rounds | $0.03 |
| 2 agents, 3 rounds | $0.08 |
| 3 agents, 3 rounds | $0.12 |
| 3 agents, 5 rounds | $0.25 |

Bring your own API keys -- Aragora never marks up LLM costs.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| "No API keys configured" | Export `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| "gh: command not found" | `brew install gh` (macOS) |
| Empty output | Ensure diff has changes: `git diff main \| wc -l` |
| Timeout | Increase with `--timeout 600` |

## Feedback

We're looking for:
1. Does the review catch real issues in your PRs?
2. Are there false positives? Which ones?
3. How does it compare to your current review process?
4. What's missing?
