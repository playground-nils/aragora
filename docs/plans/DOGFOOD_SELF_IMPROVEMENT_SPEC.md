# Dogfooding Spec: Aragora Self-Improvement Pipeline

Generated: 2026-02-28
Status: Execution-ready (plan/spec only)

## 0) Observed Runtime Reality (from live dogfood attempts)

Initial multi-model `aragora ask` runs failed before synthesis output. Blocking faults were:

- Claude agent timeout at 60s (`Agent claude timed out after 60.0s`)
- Debate timeout (`Debate timed out after 240-420s`)
- Anthropic credit/billing failure in background research path
- Context/evidence interface mismatches (`query_semantic`, `search_evidence` attribute errors)
- Calibration fusion adapter method mismatch (fixed)
- Consensus mode `hybrid` routing fallback to `none` (fixed)
- Post-debate async timeout too short for evaluator steps (fixed)

### Post-fix validation update (2026-02-28)

A subsequent live run completed successfully with the required four-model roster and `--consensus hybrid`:

- Command exited `0` after debate + pipeline + decision integrity package
- No `search_evidence` adapter crash
- No Grok terminal `410` failure (`Live search is deprecated`)
- No "unknown consensus mode: hybrid" downgrade

Residual issues still observed:

- `knowledge_mound` context injection still receives an incompatible object in one path (`query_semantic` warning)
- Pre-debate research path can still emit provider quota warnings (now fail-soft, no run abort)
- Final synthesized answer can truncate under heavy output; needs explicit output-length guard/continuation behavior

Implication: Phase P0 remains the top priority until these residual reliability/quality gaps are closed.

## 1) Clarified Intent Matrix

| Field | Spec |
|---|---|
| Objective function | Produce orchestration-ready self-improvement specs that are executable, testable, and auditable with reduced single-model bias. |
| Primary users | Founder/power-user first, then CTO/team mode. |
| Required model set | Claude Opus 4.7 (Claude Code), GPT-5.3 Codex, Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview, Grok 4.20 must be represented in protocol. |
| Non-goals | No broad feature expansion, no new UI surfaces until reliability + spec quality gates pass. |
| Hard constraints | Spec-first execution, explicit acceptance criteria, dissent preserved, rollback for every task, receipt/provenance for every stage. |
| Acceptance criteria | End-to-end run emits all required sections + orchestration JSON; impairment metric <= 0.50; zero blocker runtime errors for 3 consecutive runs. |
| Escalation triggers | Any timeout cascade, missing required section, missing rollback plan, missing test plan, or missing dissent record blocks execution. |

## 2) Debate Protocol Spec (Light Roles, Required Model Presence)

### 2.1 Model roster requirement

Every debate must include all four model lineages in some form:

- `claude` (Claude Code, Opus 4.6)
- `codex` (GPT-5.3 Codex)
- `gemini` (Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview)
- `grok` (Grok 4.20)

### 2.2 Role guidance (not rigid pigeonholing)

Roles are soft and rotate per round:

- Round A: default role assignment
- Round B: proposer/critic rotation
- Round C+: free-form adversarial + synthesis passes

Constraint: each model must contribute at least one proposal and one critique before final synthesis.

### 2.3 Debate phases

1. Intent lock: objective, constraints, non-goals, acceptance criteria
2. Proposal pass: each model proposes plan variant
3. Adversarial pass: each model critiques a different model's proposal
4. Cross-verification pass: challenge unverifiable claims and missing tests
5. Synthesis pass: merged plan + dissent ledger + unresolved risks

### 2.4 Dissent and truth-seeking requirements

- Dissent cannot be dropped; must appear in final artifact.
- Every high-impact claim must be tagged as `verifiable_now`, `verifiable_later`, or `non-verifiable`.
- Persuasion-vs-truth check is mandatory before finalization.

### 2.5 Fail-soft behavior

If one model is unavailable, the run continues in degraded mode but final output is labeled `incomplete_roster=true` and cannot auto-execute.

## 6) Recommended Dogfood Sequence

1. Reliability gates only (P0) until synthesis output is stable.
2. Spec-quality gates (P1) once runs complete reliably.
3. Impairment benchmarking + automation (P2) after P0/P1 pass.
