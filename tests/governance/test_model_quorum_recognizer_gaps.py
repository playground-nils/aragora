"""Governance tests pinning the current state of `_infer_model_reviewer_from_text`.

These tests are the regression target for the Tier 4 model-quorum-family
expansion patch designed in `docs/specs/MODEL_QUORUM_FAMILY_EXPANSION.md`.
They exist for two reasons:

1. They *pin* the current state of the recognizer so that the Tier 4 patch
   has an explicit, machine-checkable regression floor — the patch must
   keep the existing claude/openai/gemini/grok/mistral/deepseek/qwen/kimi
   markers working while *adding* recognition for the new families.

2. They *demonstrate* the gap: each of the new families (GLM, MiniMax, Yi,
   Hermes) currently returns `unknown_model_reviewer`, which means a
   reviewer signal posted by that family — even if grounded on the
   current head SHA, even if posted by a non-author account — would not
   be counted toward the quorum.

After the Tier 4 patch lands, the gap-demonstration tests will need to be
inverted (assert that the family IS recognized). At that point the tests
also become the regression floor for the new state.

Per `docs/REVIEW_AUTHORITY_PRINCIPLES.md::Family-additive change governance`:

  > "A change that adds a new family marker ... is a Tier 4
  >  merge-authority self-modification. ... The pre-approval artifact ...
  >  is a design document in docs/specs/ ... and failing governance tests
  >  in tests/governance/ that pin the current state of the gate so the
  >  implementation has a regression target."

This file IS that pre-approval test surface. The implementation that
satisfies these tests waits for operator preapproval.
