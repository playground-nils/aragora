"""End-to-end test for thinking trace flow from API response to receipt metadata.

Verifies the full pipeline:
1. AnthropicAPIAgent._parse_content_blocks() separates thinking from text
2. Thinking is stored as _last_thinking_trace
3. get_metadata() returns thinking and budget
4. Text output is clean (no thinking leaked)
