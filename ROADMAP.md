# Aragora Product Roadmap

**Last Updated:** March 25, 2026

---

## Current Status (March 2026)

Aragora has shipped the closed-loop backbone (CLB) infrastructure, the 14/14 issue sprint, Phase 2 truth-seeking advances, and **proven the live founder loop repeatable** (5/5 consecutive runs, 35-62s, March 24, 2026). The March 21-24 work stream materially advanced the product loop: live debate receipts are now visible on API/dashboard surfaces, the prompt-to-spec engine works end-to-end, and the inbox trust wedge CLI is dogfood-ready. The current gate is design partner readiness and inbox wedge dogfooding, not enterprise certification.

**By the numbers:**
- 3,846 Python files under `aragora/`
- 5,174 test files under `tests/`
- 674 Markdown docs under `docs/`
- 42 Knowledge Mound adapter specs registered
- 43 agent types available across CLI, API, local, and proxy providers
- SOC 2 controls framework: 98% implemented

**Completed since January 2026:**
- Nomic Loop end-to-end self-improvement (66 E2E tests passing)
- Knowledge Mound Phase A2 (contradiction detection, confidence decay, RBAC governance, analytics)
- Unified Memory Gateway (MemoryGateway + RetentionGate + CrossSystemDedupEngine + RLMMemoryNavigator + ClaudeMemAdapter)
- Pipeline orchestration — 4-stage Idea-to-Execution (Ideas → Goals → Workflows → Orchestration)
- Compliance CLI (`aragora compliance export`) for EU AI Act artifact bundles
- Settlement hooks with cryptographic Gauntlet receipts
- Voice/TTS integration wired end-to-end (STT + TTS)
- Multi-tenancy isolation, resource quotas, and usage metering
- RBAC v2 fully integrated across all KM adapters
- Closed-loop backbone sprint (14 CLB issues: canonical contracts, spec gates, deliberation handoff, execution bundles, verification bundles, receipt normalization, outcome feedback, trust-tier propagation, external verifier, golden-path test, dogfood profile)
- PR watch daemon fleet (3 Mac machines, 30 autonomous reviews/hour)
- Dev swarm coordination layer
- LLM-powered scope validation and blocker classification (6 async methods with fail-closed semantics)
- Ralph observability dashboard (7 Prometheus metrics, 10 REST API endpoints, YAML state data service)
- File-scope propagation fix for swarm work orders (#884)
- LLM-first vague-goal expansion replacing keyword templates (#888)
- Live settings/API-key tab wiring to backend auth endpoints ([#1146](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/pull/1146))
- Live debate creation from the debates page ([#1147](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/pull/1147))
- Truthful partial-public status surface ([#1148](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/pull/1148))
- Refresh-aware pipeline feedback scoping ([#1149](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/pull/1149))
- Visible pipeline golden-path summary ([#1150](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/pull/1150))
- `PipelineKMBridge` precedent loading before debate ([#1151](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/pull/1151))
- Queue max-parallel-two safety slice ([#1141](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/pull/1141))
- Queue harvest command ([#1164](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/pull/1164))

**Completed since March 23, 2026 (latest):**
- Live founder loop proven repeatable: 5/5 consecutive runs (35-62s), all 7 acceptance items pass
- Quickstart receipts persist to receipt store (API/dashboard/share-link visible)
- Prompt-to-spec CLI (`aragora spec`) completes end-to-end in ~23s
- Inbox trust wedge CLI: `aragora triage auth` (OAuth), `--dry-run`, `--auto-approve`
- Phase 2 truth-seeking wired: Prover-Estimator consensus, cross-verification, truth ratio vote weights
- Embedding rate limit resilience (hash-based fallback on 429 errors)
- Summary preamble cleaning (strip LLM chain-of-thought from CLI output)
- EU AI Act compliance bundle verified end-to-end with real quickstart receipts

**Remaining tracked priority work:**
- Dogfood the inbox trust wedge on a real Gmail inbox (CLI is ready)
- Clear the design-partner onboarding readiness checklist for the live founder loop (`docs/plans/2026-03-25-design-partner-onboarding-readiness-checklist.md`)
- Prepare for design partner outreach with repeatable live demo and evidence pack
- Keep pentest / SOC 2 preparation warm, after design partner validation ([#273](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/issues/273), [#274](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/issues/274), [#509](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/issues/509))

**Founder risk register:** See [docs/plans/FOUNDER_RISK_REGISTER_2026_03.md](docs/plans/FOUNDER_RISK_REGISTER_2026_03.md) for the current PMF, trust, onboarding, ops, and technical cohesion tripwires and direct mitigations.

**EU AI Act enforcement date: August 2, 2026** — the compliance CLI and audit trail infrastructure
position Aragora as a natural adoption path for enterprises facing this deadline.

## Vision

Aragora is the control plane for multi-agent vetted decisionmaking across organizational knowledge and channels. We orchestrate heterogeneous AI agents to debate, synthesize, and deliver defensible decisions through structured vetted decisionmaking—building institutional memory with full audit trails.

---

## Stop-Doing Ledger (March 2026)

Near-term planning is now constrained by the [stop-doing ledger](docs/strategy/STOP_DOING_LEDGER_2026_03.md). If a proposed project does not strengthen Aragora's current wedge, it should be explicitly deferred or rejected instead of quietly remaining "strategic."

Current wedge:
- auditable multi-model execution and review for consequential engineering work
- receipts, provenance, and truthful stopping behavior as first-class product outputs
- dogfooded product paths that are usable in live founder/design-partner loops now: `aragora review`, prompt-to-spec, and the inbox trust wedge

Default stop-doing calls:
- Reject near-term work that mostly increases generic substrate breadth: more provider/count bragging, generic orchestration infrastructure, default huge swarms, or ecosystem/marketplace surface area without live user pull.
- Defer work that may matter later but does not currently close PMF: pentest expansion, cloud marketplace listings, large-scale coordination, vertical packages, and cryptoeconomic productization.
- Advance work that shortens time-to-first-useful-result, improves receipt/review/operator clarity, or makes design-partner demos and wedge dogfooding more repeatable.

## Q2-Q4 2026 Forward Plan

This section captures the prioritized forward roadmap as of March 2026, organized by quarter and theme.
Execution priority source of truth: [docs/status/NEXT_STEPS_CANONICAL.md](docs/status/NEXT_STEPS_CANONICAL.md). This roadmap summarizes quarter-level themes and does not supersede canonical execution priorities.

The March 2026 product cohesion assessment found ~25% effective feature completeness for actual use. The March 21-24 work stream changed the material facts: the live founder loop is now proven repeatable, receipts are visible on product surfaces, Phase 2 truth-seeking is wired, and the inbox trust wedge is CLI-ready. The near-term roadmap now prioritizes dogfooding the second workflow and design partner outreach.

**EU AI Act enforcement: August 2, 2026.** This remains a real forcing function, but the compliance package only matters commercially if the core PMF loop is usable enough to demo and adopt.

Future-evolution framing: [docs/strategy/FUTURE_EVOLUTION_AFTER_PROOF.md](docs/strategy/FUTURE_EVOLUTION_AFTER_PROOF.md).
That memo describes how the wedge expands after proof. It does not change the
current source of truth: prove the inbox/design-partner wedge first, then widen
into adjacent workflows and enterprise packaging in sequence.

### Q2 2026 Priorities
- [x] Prove the live founder loop (5/5 runs, 35-62s, all acceptance items pass — March 24, 2026)
- [x] Productize the founder-loop result surfaces (receipts persist to store for API/dashboard/share-link)
- [x] Prompt-to-spec engine (`aragora spec` end-to-end in ~23s)
- [x] Phase 2 truth-seeking: Prover-Estimator, cross-verification, truth ratio vote weights wired
- [x] Inbox trust wedge CLI ready (`aragora triage auth`, `--dry-run`)
- [ ] Dogfood the inbox trust wedge on a real Gmail inbox
- [ ] Clear the design-partner onboarding readiness checklist before the next live founder-loop invite
- [x] Agent-first beta: OpenClaw fleet deployed on 3 machines, running `aragora review` on real PRs via REST API
- [x] GitHub Actions pre-merge gate (`aragora-review-gate.yml` shipped)
- [x] Public demo at aragora.ai/demo (PR #705; standalone demo page live)
- [ ] EU AI Act compliance package — keep packaging warm without displacing PMF loop closure

### Post-Proof Expansion Sequence

These are the intended gates after the current wedge is proven. They are not
parallel near-term priorities.

1. Deepen the inbox/founder loop until it is clearly painful to remove.
2. Reuse the same receipt-governed control plane for adjacent consequential flows such as PR review, bounded execution, and merge gating.
3. Package proven flows into a cohesive workbench and only then widen enterprise hardening, verticals, and long-horizon accountability bets.

### Q3 2026 Priorities
- [ ] 10+ agent coordination at enterprise scale ([#815](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/issues/815))
- [ ] Pentest / SOC 2 engagement kickoff after PMF proof ([#273](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/issues/273), [#274](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/issues/274), [#509](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/issues/509))
- [ ] ERC-8004 on-chain deployment ([#816](https://github.com/synaptent/aragora/issues/816))
- [ ] Cloud marketplace listings: AWS Marketplace and Azure Marketplace
- [ ] Vertical packages: Healthcare (FHIR/HIPAA), Financial Services (SOX/audit), Legal
- [ ] Skills marketplace pilot (community agent templates)
- [ ] Kubernetes Operator for automated horizontal scaling

### Q4 2026 Priorities
- [ ] Cross-organization federation foundation
- [ ] Decision-Integrity UI Workbench (visual debate canvas)

### 2027 Horizon
- ~~Prover-Estimator debate protocol~~ **SHIPPED** (March 2026)
- Canvas GUI 8-stage visual pipeline
- Market resolution mechanism (long-horizon settlement)
- ERC-8004 on-chain deployment to mainnet
