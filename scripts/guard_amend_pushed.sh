#
# v13 lane P72. Implements R19 ("never --amend a pushed commit"). Run this
# before `git commit --amend` (or `git rebase -i` that would rewrite HEAD)
# to confirm the current HEAD has not yet been pushed to <remote>/<branch>.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  HEAD is local-only (or remote branch absent) — amend is safe.
#   1  AMEND-BLOCKED: HEAD SHA equals remote branch tip — refuse amend.
#   2  Usage / invocation error (not in a git repo, bad flags, etc.).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/guard_amend_pushed.sh [--remote NAME] [--branch NAME]
#
# Defaults:
#   --remote origin
#   --branch  current branch (`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`)

Usage: scripts/guard_amend_pushed.sh [--remote NAME] [--branch NAME]

Refuses `git commit --amend` when the current HEAD is already published
on the remote tracking branch. Implements v13 rule R19.

Options:
  --remote NAME   remote name (default: origin)
  --branch NAME   branch name (default: current branch from HEAD)
  -h, --help      show this help and exit

Exit codes:
  0  amend is safe (HEAD ahead of remote, or remote branch absent)
  1  AMEND-BLOCKED (HEAD == remote tip)
  2  usage / invocation error
