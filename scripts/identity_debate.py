   - Convergence detection via semantic similarity
   - Crux identification for load-bearing assumptions
   - Trickster detection for hollow consensus

### 6. AGENT LAYER (98% mature)
   - 15+ AI providers: Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, Llama, Yi
   - OpenRouter fallback on ANY provider failure (429, 400 billing, timeouts)
   - Per-agent reliability weights and calibration tracking
   - Position tracking and flip detection

### 7. NOMIC LOOP - Self-Improvement (60% mature - experimental)
   - Autonomous self-improvement: debate->design->implement->verify->commit
   - Constitutional verification (rules govern the rule-changer)
   - Protected file verification and automatic backups
   - Human approval gates for dangerous changes
   - Task decomposition for complex multi-step improvements

### 8. GAUNTLET (94% mature)
   - Adversarial stress-testing with attack types
   - Red team, devil's advocate, scaling critic, compliance personas
   - Decision receipts with cryptographic audit trails
   - 5 compliance presets: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, AI Act, Security

### 9. ENTERPRISE (85-95% mature)
   - OIDC/SAML SSO (Azure AD, Okta, Google, Auth0, Keycloak)
   - RBAC v2 with 6 default roles and 50+ permissions
   - Multi-tenancy with quota tracking and cost metering
   - Immutable audit logging

**Architectural Principles:**
- **Dialectical Reasoning**: Contradiction drives improvement, not avoided
- **Omnivorous I/O**: Ingests from ANY source, outputs to ANY channel
- **Defensible**: Every decision produces audit-ready receipts with evidence chains
- **Self-Governing**: Nomic Loop enables autonomous improvement with constitutional constraints
- **Institutional**: Accumulates organizational knowledge across all interactions

**What Makes Aragora Unique (vs ChatGPT/Copilot/single-model wrappers):**
- NOT single-model: Heterogeneous 15+ provider ensemble argues toward truth
- NOT black-box: Full provenance and explainability for every decision
- NOT stateless: Institutional memory accumulates across debates and sessions
- NOT just chat: Structured Hegelian debate protocol with phases, roles, synthesis
- NOT passive: Self-improving via Nomic Loop with constitutional constraints
- NOT text-only: Multimodal ingestion (docs, images, audio, video) + multi-channel output
- NOT isolated: 24 data connectors + bidirectional chat platform integration

**Use Cases:**
- Code review at scale (24/7 multi-model consensus before human review)
- Compliance audits (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2 attack personas with audit trails)
- Architectural decisions (multi-perspective analysis with dissent recorded)
- Security red-teaming (systematic adversarial stress testing)
- Document analysis (cross-reference thousands of documents with citations)
- Inbox management (priority extraction, signal/noise separation)
- Enterprise knowledge repository (unified querying across all data sources)

# Context from the previous identity debate (to build upon)
PRIOR_DEBATE_CONTEXT = """
## Prior Identity Debate (2026-01-22)

A previous debate with limited participation (only 1/5 agents responded due to API credit issues) produced:

**Tagline:** "Aragora: Debate-driven AI for defensible decisions and continuous self-improvement"

**Description:** "Aragora is an AI platform that uses structured debate across diverse agents
to arrive at well-reasoned, auditable decisions. Unlike simple chatbots, it fosters
institutional learning and autonomously improves through a self-governing Nomic Loop."

**Feedback on this framing:** It underemphasizes several CRITICAL capabilities:

1. **Knowledge & Data Ingestion** - Aragora is not just a debate engine, it's an OMNIVOROUS
   data platform that ingests 25+ document formats, images, audio, video, and connects to
   24 data sources. This is a key differentiator from chat-only tools.

2. **Bidirectional Communication** - Aragora receives queries FROM and sends results TO
   multiple channels (Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, WhatsApp, voice, GitHub). It's not
   just an API - it's embedded in the organization's communication flow.

3. **Institutional Memory** - The 4-tier memory system with surprise-based retention and
   cross-session learning means Aragora ACCUMULATES organizational knowledge. This is
   fundamentally different from stateless chat tools.

4. **Very Long Context** - RLM provides programmatic REPL-like navigation of million-token
   contexts. This enables comprehensive document analysis that other tools cannot match.

Please address these gaps in your proposals. The ideal tagline and description should
capture ALL of these capabilities, not just the debate mechanism.
"""

DEBATE_TASK = """
Define Aragora's core identity in a single compelling sentence.

## Context
You are debating the identity of Aragora, a 710K+ line codebase with 43,500+ tests.
A previous debate produced a tagline that was criticized for underemphasizing key capabilities.
Your task is to improve upon it.

## Key Capabilities to Emphasize (often overlooked)
1. **Omnivorous Data Ingestion**: 25+ document formats, images, audio, video, 24 data connectors
2. **Institutional Memory**: 4-tier memory, surprise-based retention, Knowledge Mound, cross-session learning
3. **Bidirectional Communication**: Receives queries AND sends results to Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram, WhatsApp, voice
4. **Debate & Synthesis**: Hegelian dialectics (Thesis->Antithesis->Synthesis), multi-agent consensus
5. **Long Context Mastery**: RLM programmatic navigation, million-token contexts, REPL-like interface
6. **Self-Improvement**: Nomic Loop (debate->design->implement->verify with constitutional constraints)

## What Makes Aragora Unique (vs ChatGPT/Copilot)
- NOT a chatbot: Structured debate protocol with phases, roles, and evidence chains
- NOT a copilot: Institutional learning that ACCUMULATES organizational knowledge
- NOT single-model: Heterogeneous 15+ provider ensemble that argues toward truth
- NOT stateless: Remembers outcomes, builds knowledge graphs, improves itself
- NOT text-only: Multimodal ingestion + multi-channel bidirectional output

## Perspectives to Consider
1. **Technical**: What does the system actually do at its core?
2. **Business**: What problem does it solve for enterprises?
3. **Philosophical**: What is its intellectual foundation?
4. **Competitive**: How is it different from other AI tools?

## Deliverables
1. ONE recommended tagline (under 15 words) - must capture MORE than just "debate"
2. ONE full description (under 50 words) - must mention data ingestion AND institutional memory
3. Brief justification for why this framing is most compelling

Focus on what's unique and defensible, not generic AI buzzwords.
