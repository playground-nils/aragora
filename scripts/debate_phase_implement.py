CURRENT STATE:
- phase_implement uses `codex exec` to write code based on a design
- Codex often times out (300s limit) on complex designs
- Codex gets cautious when detecting other agents modifying the same codebase
- Claude Code is faster and more responsive but isn't currently used

OBSERVATIONS:
- Claude Code completed the recent ~430 line implementation in one session
- Codex waits for confirmation when it detects concurrent modifications
- Different CLI tools have different strengths

OPTIONS TO DEBATE:
1. Replace Codex with Claude Code entirely
2. Use both in parallel (concurrent implementation, then merge)
3. Use Claude Code as coordinator that delegates to Codex for specific tasks
4. Sequential: Claude Code does scaffolding, Codex fills in complex logic
5. Keep Codex but with better prompting/chunking

Each agent should propose their preferred approach with specific implementation details.
Consider: reliability, speed, code quality, collaboration mechanics, error handling.""",

The nomic loop allows aragora to improve itself through:
1. Debate phase: Agents propose improvements
2. Design phase: Agents design the implementation
3. Implement phase: Currently uses Codex to write code
4. Verify phase: Tests and checks
5. Commit phase: Git commit if verified

The goal is to make phase_implement more reliable and effective.""",
