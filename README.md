# Aragora

Aragora is an auditable execution control plane for AI-assisted work. It
governs consequential decisions and execution with multi-model review,
receipts, provenance, and truthful gates.

| I want to... | Install |
|--------------|---------|
| Try a debate in 30 seconds | `pip install aragora-debate` |
| Call the Aragora API from Python | `pip install aragora-sdk` |
| Self-host the full platform | `docker compose -f deploy/demo/docker-compose.yml up` |

**Individual LLMs are unreliable. Their personas shift with context, their
confidence does not correlate with accuracy, and they often optimize for
plausible agreement instead of truth.**

Aragora treats that as a systems problem. It coordinates heterogeneous models
through structured debate and review, preserves receipts and provenance, and
stops truthfully when evidence is insufficient. The goal is not just faster AI
output, but governed AI-assisted execution you can actually inspect.

Why teams adopt Aragora:

- **Disagreement becomes useful evidence.** Models challenge each other before work advances.
- **Every consequential action has a receipt.** Review, provenance, confidence, and next steps stay inspectable.
- **Execution is bounded and truthful.** Consequential actions are denied by default unless an admin-scoped approval artifact exists.
- **Sandboxed effectors are mandatory.** Browser automation and similar effectors require an approved sandbox backend instead of host-side execution.
- **It fits above existing tools.** Use Aragora when review and governance matter; keep direct runtimes when raw speed is enough.

## Product Boundary

Aragora is not a generic autonomous-agent platform or a replacement for worker
runtimes like Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, or Pi. It is the control plane used
when AI-assisted work becomes consequential enough to require receipts, review,
provenance, bounded delegation, and truthful stopping behavior.

The explicit product non-goals are tracked in the
[Non-Goals Ledger](docs/strategy/BOUNDARIES_AND_SCOPE.md). In practice that means:

- we do not try to win on raw agent breadth or generic orchestration alone
- we do not sell lights-out autonomy as the default story
- we do not replace execution substrates; we govern work that runs through them
- we do not treat bigger swarms as a product goal unless they improve truthfulness
- we do not advance work without evidence, review, and clear terminal states

### Current Stage Vs Finish Line

The long-horizon vision is deliberately ambitious — Aragora is being built toward
an auditable operating system for consequential AI-assisted work across the full
*idea → goal → plan → action → receipt* loop, with heterogeneous adversarial
agents, calibrated trust, executable claims that can go stale and trigger bounded
repair, and proof-carrying code units that fail closed when their evidence
decays. The staged evolution — Tool → Teammate → Foreman → Chief of Staff →
Organization Substrate — is laid out in
[docs/CANONICAL_GOALS.md](docs/CANONICAL_GOALS.md) with the sequencing through
narrow reliability wedges in
[docs/plans/ARAGORA_EVOLUTION_ROADMAP.md](docs/plans/ARAGORA_EVOLUTION_ROADMAP.md).

**What Aragora is *today* is narrower than that finish line, and deliberately so.**
The current promise is a trustworthy control plane for bounded AI-assisted
software execution — with receipts, review, and truthful stopping behavior.
Current-stage commercial positioning lives in
[docs/COMMERCIAL_OVERVIEW.md](docs/COMMERCIAL_OVERVIEW.md); near-term execution
sequencing lives in
[docs/status/NEXT_STEPS_CANONICAL.md](docs/status/NEXT_STEPS_CANONICAL.md). The
Decision Integrity Core tranche — crux-finding, executable claims, proof-carrying
code — is tracked in
[docs/plans/EPISTEMIC_CI_AND_CRUX_ENGINE.md](docs/plans/EPISTEMIC_CI_AND_CRUX_ENGINE.md)
and gated on Foreman reliability. Claims here should stay narrower than the
measured proof; the long-term vision is earned stage by stage, not asserted.

## Try It Now

**Option A -- One command, no API keys:**

```bash
pip install aragora && aragora demo
```

This runs a full adversarial debate with mock agents and opens a decision receipt in your browser.

**Option B -- Docker (includes dashboard UI):**

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/demo/docker-compose.yml up
# Open http://localhost:3000 — try any question in the playground
```

**Option C -- Live playground:**

Visit the deployed instance and type any question. Three AI agents will debate it, critique each other, vote, and produce a shareable decision receipt.

================================================================
  ARAGORA DEMO -- Adversarial Decision Stress-Test
================================================================

  Topic:  Should we adopt microservices?
  Agents: Analyst, Critic, Synthesizer, Devil's Advocate
  Rounds: 2

  --- Round 1 --------------------------------------------------

  [ANALYST] (supportive)
    This is a sound strategy. The evidence points toward
    significant gains in maintainability and team productivity.

  [CRITIC] (critical)
    The claimed benefits are overstated. Most organizations
    underestimated the operational burden by 3-5x. I recommend
    a modular monolith as the safer path.

  [SYNTHESIZER] (balanced)
    The tradeoffs here are real. On one hand, the current
    architecture limits independent scaling. On the other,
    the migration carries execution risk.

  --- Decision Receipt -----------------------------------------

  Verdict:    CONDITIONAL APPROVAL
  Confidence: 72%
  Consensus:  Partial (3 of 4 agents)
  Dissent:    Devil's Advocate flagged migration risk
```

</details>

```bash
# Review your current changes against main
git diff main | aragora review --demo

# Or review a GitHub PR
aragora review --pr https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123 --demo
```

```bash
# Stress-test a specification
aragora gauntlet spec.md --profile thorough --output receipt.html

# Run a multi-agent debate
aragora ask "Design a rate limiter for 1M req/sec" --agents anthropic-api,openai-api,gemini

# Start the API server
aragora serve
```

### Self-Improving Pipeline

Aragora can improve itself under explicit supervision -- decompose a vague goal,
assign subtasks to isolated worktrees, execute with gauntlet validation, and
merge passing branches:

```bash
# Preview what the pipeline will do
aragora self-improve "Maximize utility for SME businesses" --dry-run

# Run with human approval gates and budget cap
aragora self-improve "Harden security" --require-approval --budget-limit 20 --receipt
```

Each subtask gets an isolated git worktree, cross-agent review, sandbox
validation, and a receipt trail before merge or truthful escalation. This is a
governed execution path, not a claim that Aragora is a generic autonomous-agent
runtime.

Current default boundary:

- public and issue-driven paths can draft plans and receipts, but cannot execute code, drive browsers, mutate git, emit consequential webhooks, or write on-chain without an explicit approval record
- browser execution requires a sandbox backend; host-side browser automation is disabled by default
- blockchain write requests queue durable chain actions for an admin signer lane instead of signing in the request path

## Five Pillars

Aragora is built on five architectural commitments designed for a world where individual AI agents cannot be trusted with consequential decisions alone.

### 1. SMB-Ready, Enterprise-Grade

Aragora is useful to a 5-person startup on day one and scales to regulated enterprise without rearchitecting. Enterprise features -- OIDC/SAML SSO, MFA, AES-256-GCM encryption, multi-tenant isolation, RBAC with 7 roles and 450+ permission combinations, SOC 2 / GDPR / HIPAA compliance frameworks -- are built in, not bolted on. Security hardening (rate limiting, SSRF protection, path traversal guards, input validation, audit trails) is the default, not a premium tier.

### 2. Leading-Edge Memory and Context

Single agents lose context. Aragora's 4-tier Continuum Memory (fast / medium / slow / glacial) and Knowledge Mound with 42 registered adapter specs give every debate access to institutional history, cross-session learning, and evidence provenance. The RLM (Recursive Language Models) system compresses and structures context to reduce prompt bloat, enabling debates that sustain coherence across long multi-round sessions and large document sets where individual models would degrade.

### 3. Control Plane Above Worker Runtimes

Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Pi, and similar tools are useful execution
substrates. Aragora sits above them when the work needs governance: bounded
delegation, explicit review, receipt generation, merge and publish gates, and
truthful blocker handling. Provider breadth, connectors, SDKs, and workflow
surfaces matter because they let Aragora fit into your stack, but they are
supporting infrastructure, not the primary moat.

### 4. Multi-Agent Robustness

Individual LLMs exhibit persona instability -- their outputs shift based on framing, context, and even prompt ordering. Aragora treats this as a feature: by running Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, and local models in structured Propose / Critique / Revise debates, the system surfaces disagreements that reveal genuine uncertainty. ELO rankings track agent performance. Calibration scoring (Brier scores) measures prediction accuracy. The Trickster detects hollow consensus where models agree without genuine reasoning. The result: when models with different training data independently converge on an answer, that convergence is meaningful -- and when they disagree, the dissent trail tells you exactly where human judgment is needed.

### 5. Self-Healing and Self-Extending

The Nomic Loop is Aragora's autonomous self-improvement system: agents debate improvements to the codebase, design solutions, implement code, run tests, and verify changes -- with human approval gates and automatic rollback on failure. This is how Aragora grew from a debate engine to 3,800+ modules. Red-team mode stress-tests the platform's own specs. The Gauntlet runs adversarial attacks against proposed changes. The system hardens itself.

---

## Why Aragora?

A single LLM will confidently give you a wrong answer and you won't know it. Research shows that LLM personas are context-dependent, fragile under adversarial pressure, and prone to sycophantic agreement with whoever is asking. [Stanford's taxonomy of LLM reasoning failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06176) documents systematic breakdowns in formal logic, unfaithful chain-of-thought, and robustness failures under minor prompt variations -- exactly the failure modes that structured adversarial debate is designed to surface. When the decision matters -- hiring, architecture, compliance, strategy -- one model's opinion is insufficient.

Aragora treats each model as an **unreliable witness** and uses structured debate, review, and receipts to extract signal from disagreement instead of hiding it behind a single routed answer:

| What you get | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Adversarial Validation** | Models with different training data and blind spots challenge each other's reasoning |
| **Decision Receipts** | Cryptographic audit trails with evidence chains, dissent tracking, and confidence calibration |
| **Gauntlet Mode** | Red-team stress-tests for specs, policies, and architectures using adversarial personas |
| **Calibrated Trust** | ELO rankings and Brier scores track which models are actually reliable on which domains |
| **Institutional Memory** | Decisions persist across sessions with 4-tier memory and Knowledge Mound (<!-- adpt-count -->42<!-- /adpt-count --> adapters) |
| **Channel Delivery** | Results route to Slack, Teams, Discord, Telegram, WhatsApp, email, or voice |

### If You're New: How To Read Aragora

Aragora is designed for the moment after an AI recommendation is made, when a buyer, reviewer, or operator asks: "Why should I trust this enough to act?"

Every consequential run is explained through three plain-language elements:

| Term | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| **Receipt** | The record of what was asked, what Aragora recommended, and what should happen next |
| **Evidence** | The documents, policies, tests, prior decisions, or artifacts Aragora relied on |
| **Dissent** | The disagreements, residual risks, or open questions that still need human judgment |

The goal is not to make AI sound more certain. The goal is to make the decision legible. A first-time operator should be able to answer four questions in under a minute:

1. What happened?
2. Why did the system reach that recommendation?
3. What could still be wrong?
4. What is the next human action?

That is the purpose of Aragora receipts: not just a log, but a reviewable handoff.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install and Try It (30 seconds to demo, ~5 minutes for a real PR review)

```bash
pip install aragora

# Run a zero-config demo debate — opens receipt in your browser
aragora quickstart --demo

# From a clone of the target repo, review the live GitHub PR head
aragora review-pr 123
```

`aragora review-pr` fetches the current remote PR head from GitHub, prints a pass or changes-requested summary, and writes artifacts under `.aragora/review-pr/`. For the first real run, make sure `gh auth status` succeeds and at least one reviewer is available (`claude`, `codex`, or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).

See [docs/QUICKSTART_DEVELOPER.md](docs/QUICKSTART_DEVELOPER.md) for the 5-minute `review-pr` path, artifact layout, and optional fix loop.

### 2. Run Debates and Start the Server

```bash
# Set at least one API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key  # or OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY, XAI_API_KEY

# Run a multi-agent debate
aragora ask "Should we adopt microservices?" --agents anthropic-api,openai-api --rounds 3

# Start the API server
aragora serve
```

See [docs/guides/GETTING_STARTED.md](docs/guides/GETTING_STARTED.md) for the complete 5-minute setup.

### 3. Deploy with Docker

```bash
# Clone and deploy
git clone https://github.com/synaptent/aragora && cd aragora

# Production deployment (secrets from AWS Secrets Manager)
cd deploy/liftmode && ./setup.sh

# Or run directly with Docker Compose
docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for full deployment options (Docker, Kubernetes, offline mode).

### 4. Develop with the SDK

| Package | Install | Purpose | PyPI |
|---|---|---|---|
| `aragora` | `pip install aragora` | Full platform (server, CLI, debate engine) | [v2.8.0](https://pypi.org/project/aragora/) |
| `aragora-debate` | `pip install aragora-debate` | Standalone debate engine (no server needed) | [v0.2.0](https://pypi.org/project/aragora-debate/) |
| `aragora-sdk` | `pip install aragora-sdk` | Python client SDK for connecting to aragora | [v2.8.0](https://pypi.org/project/aragora-sdk/) |
| `@aragora/sdk` | `npm install @aragora/sdk` | TypeScript/Node.js client SDK | — |

---

## Core Workflows

### 1. Gauntlet Mode -- Adversarial Stress Testing

Stress-test specs, architectures, and policies before they ship:

```bash
aragora gauntlet spec.md --input-type spec --profile quick
aragora gauntlet policy.yaml --input-type policy --persona gdpr
aragora gauntlet architecture.md --profile thorough --output report.html
```

| Attack Type | What It Tests |
|---|---|
| **Red Team** | Security holes, injection points, auth bypasses |
| **Devil's Advocate** | Logic flaws, hidden assumptions, edge cases |
| **Scaling Critic** | Performance bottlenecks, SPOF, thundering herd |
| **Compliance** | GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, AI Act violations |

Decision receipts provide cryptographic audit trails for every finding.

### 2. AI Code Review

Get **multi-model consensus** on your pull requests:

```bash
git diff main | aragora review
aragora review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
aragora review --demo  # try without API keys
```

When 3+ independent models with different training data agree on an issue, that convergence is meaningful. Split opinions show where human judgment is needed -- the disagreement is the signal.

### 3. Structured Debates

The debate protocol follows thesis > antithesis > synthesis:

1. **Propose** -- Agents generate initial responses from different perspectives
2. **Critique** -- Agents challenge each other's proposals with severity scores
3. **Revise** -- Proposers incorporate valid critiques
4. **Synthesize** -- Judge combines best elements into a final answer

Configurable consensus: majority, unanimous, judge-based, or none.

## Self-Improvement (Nomic Loop)

Aragora includes an autonomous self-improvement system where agents debate and implement improvements to the codebase itself. **Experimental** -- always run in a sandbox with human review.

```bash
python scripts/run_nomic_with_stream.py run --cycles 3
python scripts/self_develop.py --goal "Improve test coverage" --require-approval
```

Safety: automatic backups, protected file checksums, rollback on failure, explicit approval gates for consequential actions, sandbox-required browser execution, and asynchronous chain settlement.

*The name "aragora" evokes the Greek agora -- the public assembly where citizens debated and reached collective decisions through reasoned discourse.*
